# crop

> **You are an expert software engineer.**
>
> Build a full-featured **Python desktop application** using **PyQt6** that assists farmers with crop rotation decisions, soil health management, and modern farming practices.
>
>pls before you pls create a virtual environment using 
> python -m venv ur virtualevironmentname then enter
>after that activate the evinronment 
> then you can run pip install -r requirements.txt
> * **Python 3.x**
> * **PyQt6** – GUI framework
> * **SQLite** – local storage (using Python's built-in `sqlite3`)
>
> ### 📁 Project Structure:
> Create the following files:
>
> 1. `main.py` – Launch the PyQt6 GUI
> 2. `classes.py` – Define classes for:
>
>    * `Crop`
>    * `Soil`
>    * `FarmingTechnique`
> 3. `logic.py` – Implement:
>
>    * Crop rotation logic
>    * Soil/fertilizer recommendation system
>    * Modern farming technique suggestions
> 4. `database.py` – Handle:
>
>    * SQLite operations (create/read/write/delete)
>    * Data persistence for user entries
>
> ### 🧠 Features:
>
> * **User Input** through GUI:
>
>   * Farmland size
>   * Previous crop
>   * Current crop
>   * Soil type
> * **Crop Rotation Logic:**
>
>   * Prevent planting of same crop family consecutively
>   * Suggest suitable alternatives
> * **Soil & Fertilizer Recommendation:**
>
>   * Suggest fertilizers and soil management based on:
>
>     * Soil type
>     * Crop history
> * **Modern Farming Techniques:**
>
>   * Recommend techniques like:
>
>     * Drip irrigation
>     * Intercropping
>     * Precision farming
> * **SQLite Database:**
>
>   * Store user inputs
>   * Store crop, soil, and technique data
> * **Error Handling:**
>
>   * Validate user input (empty/invalid entries)
>   * Handle incorrect data formats
>
> ### ✅ Testing Plan:
>
> * Validate user input types and completeness
> * Ensure correct recommendations are generated
> * Check if data is saved and retrieved correctly
